CGxx - Object-Oriented Implementation of the Conjugate Gradients Method
=======================================================================

This implementation can make use of different programming models:
 * CUDA
 * OpenACC
 * OpenCL
 * OpenMP

If applicable, the offloading programming model also includes a version for multiple devices.
In addition, there is a serial implementation for reference.

Environment variables
---------------------

| Name | Description | Allowed values | Default value |
